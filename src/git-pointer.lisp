;;; Memory management
;;;
;;; The tricky thing is memory management, we use trivial-garbage:finalize, but
;;; that only takes a function with no arguments, so we do not know what
;;; we are finalizing.  Now of course we can create a closure containing
;;; extra information, but if that refers to the object it will keep
;;; the object alive so it is never collected, so we have to create a parallel
;;; 'object' containing the relevant information.
;;;
;;; What do we need for 'finalize'
;;;
;;; 1 - The libgit pointer to call free on
;;; 2 - All dependend objects that need to be invalidated.
;;;
